        "community data jar" is an exercise in uncovering and experiencing
        someone else's daily digital experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        For "lock screen exchange," participants submit a picture of their lock
        screen and receive a random lock screen from another participant to set
        as their own for the rest of the day. This act invites experiencing
        someone else's normally hidden digital environment as your reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The collection of lock screen photos were then transformed into a
        collective mural, forming Kernel Magazine's 4th Issue for the launch
        event.
